# DS_transfer_mouse
The goal of this project is to learn the relationship between the transcriptomic profiles of Down syndrome (DS) mouse models (Ts65Dn, Dp16, TcMAC21, etc.,  see !["Moyer et al."](https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(20)30253-5?dgcid=raven_jbs_aip_email#secst0080) for a more detailed description of DS animal models). The relationship between mouse models with typical karyotypes and those simulating trisomy 21 is complicated by the 1.5 upregulation of genes homologous to those on human chromosome 21 (HSA12). Therefore, we hypothesize that learning this relationship requires models appopriate for learning this complex function. The repository provides the code and data necessary for creating and evaluating these deep learning models.
